%%Every Tester
[Success, Factors] = everytester(set, Factors);
%This function interatively tests a lot of wavelet functions to see which,
%if any, will improve upon our current model. The goal, ultimately, is to
%converge upon a set that will put us at 90% accuracy.
%Factors is a list of all of the types we'd like to test

%% Topics
% NNs
% Bayes Classifier
% Reconnection policies - these will have to be much more algorithmic > ML
% Color Correcting the image


%% Generate Color Corrections
% Test varied color color corrections
% Also test different combinations of summation and complementing


%% Generate wavelet battery
% Preserver unchanged wavelets





%Multilayer loop?
%Altly: pre-prepare a set of all the test values we'd like to do, then
%expand and expand until we start to see an improvement gradient drop


%% Train NN

%% Train Bayes


%% Test and record results

%% Record image of recent maxima


%%Rinse and Repeat


%% Testing different input types altogether might be a project for a different time.
