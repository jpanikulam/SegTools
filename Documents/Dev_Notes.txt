    >Improving Image Post-Processing/Cleanup methods
        - Solidity, perimeter, area
        - Perimeter/area works for small objects
        - Macro-scale region properties (Orientation, M/m axes, etc) are fundamentally inaccessible for real segmentations
         \- They will only work on 'piece-wise' images, or small objects of similar size.
           \- See if a 'local' region props for continuous objects can be implemented in Jacob time.
